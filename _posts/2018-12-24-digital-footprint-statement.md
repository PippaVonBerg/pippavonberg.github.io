## Digital Footprint Statement

My school requires me to write this statement before I start my blog. This is the foundation for how I approach everything I do online. I know how important it is to keep my information private. Once something is out there, it's out there forever. I take digital hygiene seriously and the systems I interact with.

## Ethics in Digital Systems

I've chosen to ground my work in **ethics and discipline**. To do this, I'll be reflecting on the philosophy of **Hierocles of Alexandria**, a 5th-century Neoplatonist philosopher whose teachings focus on **self-mastery, interconnected systems, and ethical action**.

One of Hierocles' ideas that resonates deeply with me is his concept of the "cosmic city," where each person's actions contribute to the whole. This perspective is essential in hacking, open source and working with digital systems. Every choice whether in code/script or in real life ripples outward affecting a larger system.

### How I'll Apply This

- **Self-Mastery:** Hacking requires discipline, patience, and creativity. Without mastery of your own impulses, systems work can become careless or unethical.
- **Ethical Action:** Every action, from testing vulnerabilities to designing frameworks, must be done with integrity and responsibility.
- **Interconnected Systems:** Hackers are part of a larger digital ecosystem. Recognizing these connections is key to making ethical decisions.

These meditations will guide my approach to hacking and frameworks while acting with intention and thoughtfulness.

## YAPPY

- **Y:** Your full name
- **A:** Address
- **P:** Phone number
- **P:** Passwords
- **Y:** Your plans and birthday

These are the things I make sure not to share. Everything else is on my terms.
