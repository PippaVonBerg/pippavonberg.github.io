### FAQs  

#### **General Questions**

**Q: Who are you?**  
A: I go by **N1x** online. I’m 16 and currently attending a private international college in Europe. This blog is my way of documenting what I’m learning and exploring - everything from hacking and math to random ideas that come up.

**Q: Where are you from?**  
A: My background is a mix of American and South African. I’ve lived between Europe, Asia, and North America, so I don’t really call any one place “home.”  

**Q: Why did you start this blog?**  
A: Honestly, it’s just a space to keep track of my projects and thoughts. I’m not sure what it will turn into yet, but it’s more for me than anyone else.

#### **Academics and School Life**

**Q: What are you studying?**  
A: Mostly STEM subjects + lots of math, game design, logic, and computer science. I’m really into hacking (ethically, of course) and frameworks for anything.  

**Q: Do you have a uniform?**  
A: Yes, and it’s actually nice. I wear skirts with polos or sweaters, and it’s simple to put together every morning.  

**Q: How’s the food at school?**  
A: It’s really good most of the time. I love breakfast the most and there’s also a little kitchen for when we want to make something ourselves. 

**Q: Do you leave campus often?**  
A: On weekdays, we’re allowed out for a couple of hours after school. Weekends are more flexible, and you can explore nearby towns, visit cafes, or just relax at the onsen.  

**Q: What’s the homework like?**  
A: It’s manageable as long as you’re organized. We have scheduled "prep time" four times a week, which helps keep everything on track.

#### **Personal Interests**

**Q: How did you get into hacking?**  
A: My grandfather owns a tech company, and I started exploring his databases when I was about 13 wanting to do bug bounty on them. SQLi is my favourite technique to use. 

**Q: Do you like Sports?**  
A: Yes, I love UFC. I grew up watching it with my grandfather. It’s shows incredible mental toughness, strategy, and discipline and I've attended two live events - one in Japan and one in Las Vegas.

**Q: What’s something unique about your school?**  
A: The location is very secluded../isolated. We’re in the mountains, so it’s peaceful, with skiing and hot springs nearby. It’s perfect for focusing on studies and enjoying nature.

#### **Room Life and Extracurriculars**

**Q: Do you get to decorate your room?**  
A: Yes, within reason. I’ve started putting up Polaroids and some ideas I am working on. It’s still a bit minimalist though.  

**Q: What’s your workout routine at school?**  
A: I go to the gym most mornings before class and do Iaido (a Japanese martial art) three times a week. I’d love to try Kung Fu one day, but it’s not practical here.  

**Q: How easy is it to make friends?**  
A: Super easy. Everyone here is from somewhere different, so we all have that in common. It’s a really supportive community, and everyone’s friendly.

#### **Quick Questions**

- **Q: Do you have a dress code?**  
  A: Yes, but it’s pretty flexible. You can accessorize and wear your own sweaters, so it’s not overly strict.  

- **Q: What’s your favorite part of boarding school?**  
  A: Community + Independence. I love having the freedom to focus on my projects while being surrounded by supportive tutors, educators, mentors and friends.  

- **Q: Are there boys at your school, or is it girls only?**  
  A: It’s mixed, which I think makes it more balanced. Boys and girls have separate dorms, but we share classes and activities.  

- **Q: Do you miss home?**  
  A: Sometimes, but I’m usually too busy to think about it.
