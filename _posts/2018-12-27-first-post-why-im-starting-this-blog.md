![Introduction](https://pippavonberg.github.io/assets/images/school-life.jpg)

Hi. This is my first post, and I’m not sure what this blog will become yet, but it’s something I’ve wanted to start for a while. Life moves fast here, and I thought it would be nice to have a place to organize my thoughts, share ideas, and track what I’m working on.

I’m 16 and studying at a private college in Europe. It’s a bit of a bubble, to be honest ...a mix of traditions, academics, and just being surrounded by the same people all the time. But it’s not bad... I spend most of my time balancing school and my own projects. Hacking is my main focus - ethical hacking, specifically (I love offensive and disuasive security and code/more specificay SQL injection). It’s like picking invisible locks, and iquid/energy keys ----- and and and. Hacking is a huge area with hundreds of topics and I made the decision to focus only on code injection (SQLi/XSS) and disuaision techniques. 

Math is another thing I work on a lot...I do a ton of linear algebra. 

The rest of the time, I’m usually in a café with friends, walking through town, or reading. I’ve been getting into books on systems thinking lately. This blog is probably going to end up being a mix of everything I care about: hacking, random ideas, math problems, game design (social) and whatever else comes up.

I am exploring ideas without overthinking it. This is not a blog about solving problems - only exploring ideas.
