*"Just as the city is made up of many houses, so are we part of a greater whole."* – Hierocles of Alexandria  

Hacking is a bunch of tiny to massive systems - all working at the same time. Hierocles’ idea of the “cosmic city” reminds me that every system is part of something bigger. My style of xing isn’t about only breaking things or breaking into things.... it’s about understanding so many systems and seeing their places in the larger ecosystem.

This is something I try to keep in mind with every project I take on. Whether it’s testing vulnerabilities or working on a framework, the goal isn’t destruction. It’s about creating something stronger and more thoughtful in its place.
