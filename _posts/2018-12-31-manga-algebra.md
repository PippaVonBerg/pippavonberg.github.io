*A Manga Guide to Linear Algebra* by Shin Takahashi + Iroha Inoue, is very high level teaching. The book uses a story format to explain concepts - it is an illustrated novel and densely packed information. Honesty - it was uncomfortable to read for the first 3/4 because I didn't resonate with their metaphors but it actually helped a lot. Everything is visual with a story to follow so you know there is an end to all of this and it is not all numbers and logic, which is exactly what I need.

My favorite part was how it explained transformations and matrices. It’s not a deep dive, but for someone like me who loves visual learning, it’s a great starting point for visualizing complex problems.
