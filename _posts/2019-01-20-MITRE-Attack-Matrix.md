*Mapping attacker behaviors step-by-step.*

### Why I Love MITRE ATT&CK  

The MITRE ATT&CK Framework (https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v3/) is a huge playbook and the most in depth step by step process for complex hacking missions. It's divided into 12 main steps, from snooping around (Reconnaissance) to causing damage (Impact).  

What makes ATT&CK so powerful is how it breaks everything into meticulous steps though it doesn't feel overwhelming. It is designed incredibly well and not cramped when looking vulns and processes up. I feel that I need to take my frameworks (self made) more seriously by documenting more and adding more information after studying MITRE. For example, there are 10+ ways a hacker might try to get in at first (Initial Access), but 67 ways they try to hide what they're doing (Defense Evasion). 

It's always being updated as new tricks are discovered, making it an indispensable tool.
