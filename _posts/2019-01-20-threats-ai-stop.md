### **Exploring AI and SQL Injection**  

I started diving into AI and its potential in cybersecurity - SQL injection was an obvious area as AI + SQLi together could ruin a database in seconds (because even a human can do it quickly with SQLMap.

With AI, **anomalous queries that would slip past traditional security tools** could be flagged instantly. This makes it an excellent ally in the fight against vulnerabilities, and the deeper I go, the more I realize how much of a game changer it is.  

Hereâ€™s how AI stands out against SQLi:  
- **Pattern Recognition:** It spots malicious queries by recognizing subtle deviations in behavior.  
- **Adaptive Response:** AI can block threats in real-time and issue dynamic patches without waiting for human intervention.  
- **Proactive Defense:** AI learns from past attacks, meaning it gets smarter over time. (OMG!)
That being said - what if this goes the other way - into the hands of the bad guys....because they will use this eventually.
